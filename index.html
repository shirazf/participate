In the film Hadj Cheriff a knife juggler throws his knives and then starts flipping and jumping around. His jumps looked like a gymnastics dance. https://www.loc.gov/item/00694123/

In the game, another knife-juggler is throwing knives at the player. The player would move with the arrow keys and jump over the knives to avoid them. The player would then attack the knife-thrower with his moves or his own knife using the keyboard (such as keys A and S).
